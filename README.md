#PokeMon Battle
---
This is my version of the classic RPG battle game. The goal of the game is to use your highly trained PokeMon to KO all of your rival trainer's PokeMon. Each PokeMon has elemental strengths and weaknesses that can be exploited to give you an edge over your opponent. 

###How to Play

The game starts with the Red trainer(left) and switches turns after every attack. To attack the opponent's PokeMon, click on one of your available attacks. Your PokeMon's 'normal' attack has the highest chance to hit the enemy PokeMon, but doesn't do much damage. The heaviest attack has the lowest accuracy, but does the most damage. Attacks are fueled by Power Points(PP). If you run out of PP, you can't use that attack. Normal attacks have the highest PP, and heavy attacks have the lowest. You can change PokeMon on your turn by clicking on one of the Poke Balls below your PokeMon's health bar. When a PokeMon's Health Points(HP) reach 0, it is Knocked Out(KO'd), and you must select another PokeMon. The game is over when all 6 of the losing trainer's PokeMon have been KO'd.

###Technologies Used

The game was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and jQuery UI. 

jQuery and jQueryUI were used primarily for DOM manipulation and animations respectively.
###User Stories

User stories were managed with Trello. You can read them and see how the project progressed [here](https://trello.com/b/eve2TBaz/pokemon-project).

###Upgrades

There are many ways the game can improve. The most notable are: 

1. Add more PokeMon and a way for players to choose which to use in the battle.
2. Animations and sounds for different moves.
3. More accurate type strengths and weaknesses.
4. More accurate damage calculations based on level and attack stats.
